    "H bridges are available as integrated circuits, or can be built from discrete components.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The term H bridge is derived from the typical graphical representation of such a circuit. An H bridge is built with four switches (solid-state or mechanical). When the switches S1 and S4 (according to the first figure) are closed (and S2 and S3 are open) a positive voltage will be applied across the motor. By opening S1 and S4 switches and closing S2 and S3 switches, this voltage is reversed, allowing reverse operation of the motor.\n",

    "### What is PWM\n",
    "Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between full on (5 Volts) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of \"on time\" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and 5v controlling the brightness of the LED.\n",

    "### Usage\n",
    "It would be something to note here. The servo motor has three leads, with one more than a DC motor. Each lead has a color code. So you have to connect the brown wire from the micro servo to the GND pin on the Arduino. Connect the red wire from the servo to the +5V on the Arduino. And finally, connect the orange wire from the SG90 servo to a digital pin (pin 9) on the Arduino.\n",
